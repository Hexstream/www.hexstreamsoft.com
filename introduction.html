  <p>Hello, I'm Jean-Philippe Paradis and for the last ~6 years I was (and still am) intensively in Common Lisp development. During that time, I developed many very useful, novel and non-trivial libraries (notably, a big bunch of libraries which constitute a kind of web framework). I recently open-sourced (MIT license) <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream">almost 100% of my code on Github</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Unfortunately</b>, since I was the only user of my libraries, there are <b>several "quality issues"</b> I absolutely didn't worry about until the open-sourcing, notably they're <b>completely undocumented</b>. As a result, almost all of them are, though publicly available, <b>currently unsuitable for public consumption</b> unless you're some kind of masochist looking for a great way to waste his time.</p>

  <p>I have recently embarked on a long journey (at least 1 year) to <b>thoroughly cleanup and comprehensively document</b> all my libraries so that anyone can use them easily. I know this will be a <b>ton</b> of work but I am determined to do it, I'm sick of being the only user of my innovations.</p>
  
  <p>(Don't get fooled by this rudimentary hand-coded page (and others), I made "really nice" HTML and CSS libraries and have some good experience with web development, but these web libraries currently are in a very sorry state so I'll use them again when their cleaning up is done and I don't want to get carried away with making high-quality pages for just one or two projects.)</p>
