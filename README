I finally decided to start managing my website's source code with Git,
so might as well publish it. And then, might as well dump it into the
public domain. Just for kicks. And because it's my usual modus
operandi. And because it might help someone somewhere at some point.

The presentation used to be quite crappy, but this changed thanks in
large part to a partial import of some of the CSS I wrote long ago for
my old "BahagonTools" project.

I'm writing the HTML and CSS by hand, which is to me unacceptable, but
I have yet to clean up my old (and awesome in some ways, but
undocumented) Common Lisp libraries for HTML and CSS (and form
validation, and lots of other cool stuff). Old story.
