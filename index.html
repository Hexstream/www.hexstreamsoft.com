              <p>These links currently point at the version of the page in the master branch, which in practice is the same as the version on the site, since I always push to github right after pushing to the site. However, this is not ideal for perusal of older, "historic" versions of the site. Platonically, I guess it would be better to do a bit of automated post-processing at deployment time to point at the exact version of the page the link was followed from.</p>

                <h1>What I did in 2013</h1>
                <section>
                  <h1>Summary</h1>
                  <p>2013 is pretty easy to summarize: I worked on my website. That's pretty much it.</p>
                  <p>At the start of 2013, my site didn't have much content at all and was really ugly. Whereas now, in the beginning of 2014 there's quite a bit more content (though not quite enough for my tastes) and everything is much better structured and presented (I'm fairly satisfied on that front, though it could use some improvements).</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                  <h1>"BahagonTools" template import and other improvements</h1>
                  <p>From March 1st 2013 to April 30th 2013 (exactly 2 months) I worked on my website every day, incidentally getting a 61 days streak on github. That was quite a nice run. The first thing I did is dig up the HTML and CSS from my old "<a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/bahagontools">BahagonTools</a>" mega-project. It was a "manual import of templates", one might call it. That instantly boosted the visual presentation of the site. And then I made a series of restructurations of content, notably I organized my <a href="libraries/">15 ready-to-use libraries</a> in categories.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                  <h1>Incomplete, unpublished mega-article</h1>
                  <p>The second big thing I did in 2013 was working on my "Notes and Tips: Standard Common Lisp symbols" mega-"article" from july to december. I have a really big vision for it and I'm quite convinced this will be a masterpiece. For now it's already pretty nice but still incomplete. It's not published yet but if you want to go look at it from the <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/com.hexstreamsoft/tree/notes-tips-cl-symbols">notes-tips-cl-symbols branch</a> I can't stop you.</p>
                  <p>I stopped working on my mega-article for now, because if I want to realize my vision for it without going completely insane I'll have to have support from my old web framework, and to have that I have to get back to Actual Programing™, which is what I wanted to do anyway because I don't really feel like I'm living if I'm not spending a sizeable portion of my time programing.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                  <h1>Non-productivity</h1>
                  <p>On the non-productive front, in 2013 I played way too much <a href="http://bombermine.com">Bombermine</a>, especially in december and in the first part of january, that was pretty much the only thing I was doing and that was obviously unsustainable, so I had to put a drastic end to that. I'm a bipolar and tend to do things either intensively or not at all, so I dropped Bombermine completely and on january 22 I made a strong public commitment not to play it again until January 1st 2015 at the earliest. So that takes care of that.</p>
                  <p>(There's a bit more to my bombermine story, but it's no longer particularly relevant so I won't recount it, at least for now.)</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                  <h1>Worknotes</h1>
                  <p>In 2013 I started implementing my "<a href="worknotes/">worknotes</a>" strategy for being able to efficiently work on multiple projects "at the same time" (in a similar fashion to how operating systems execute multiple programs "at the same time") without getting lost.</p>
                  <p>In 2014 I started by synchronizing my worknotes, my github repos and my local repos. This was a somewhat painful process which wasn't aided by the fact that I had a hard disk crash the first time I tried to do it. (The hard disk was 10+ years old so the crash was way overdue.) Various delays ensued and I had some morale problems, in part because getting back to Actual Programing™ after such a long time (8 months?) was a bit scary. Getting back to working on dozens of interrelated projects you don't remember the details of can be a bit intimidating. Fortunately this time around I have the worknotes weapon.</p>
                  <p>I also made 2 important additions to my worknotes concept: "<a href="worknotes/workstacks/">workstacks</a>" and "<a href="worknotes/checklists/">checklists</a>". For now there's only one of each but these are sure to become a staple of my workflows.</p>
                  <p>I'm still not quite disciplined enough to write down each and every work item before I actually do the work item, but I've made some progress. Some emacs support for worknotes would definitely help, and before someone suggests it, no, I don't have time to check org-mode and anyway <abbr title="Not Invented Here">NIH</abbr>.</p>

              <section>
                <h1>What I want to do in 2014</h1>
                <p>I'm already exhausted from writing all the above and I'm otherwise tired, so I'll cut this short. 2014 will be one hell of a year for me, things are really coming together this time, I think. I've been thinking that for many years in a row but whatever.</p>
                <p>I expect to finish many new libraries in 2014. Several of those are quite important to me and will result in my adopting a new Common Lisp style, which will be not quite as conservative as the one I've been using until now, but I'm sure it will be for the best.</p>
                <p>One thing I wanted to do in May 2013 was "significantly expand the actual content of [my library pages], such that all my ready-to-use libraries are comprehensively documented", but really that should happen after I'm done reviving my old web framework or well, at least hextml (which will be renamed to hexstream-html).</p>
                <p>On the <a href="https://twitter.com/StreamLisp">Stream Lisp</a> front, I'll definitely at least make a big messy braindump for it in 2014. I think I have so many of the right answers in my head and I'm tired of seeing people (apparently) get things wrong regarding the future of Lisp.</p>
                <p>So, that's it for now I guess. I really think I'll turn things around this year.</p>
